IDENTIFIED BUGS (Working on it):
1. A bug that does not display the birth date and the number of posts of a user.
2. A bug that does not show the error message when incorrect login credentials are entered.
3. A bug that does not dislike the post once you click on the like button again, but increases the amount by 1 every time instead.

   
FEATURES TO BE ADDED IN FUTURE UPDATES:
1. Freind requests
2. Chatting area (Till then, why not put your Discord ID in your bio and DM?)


Credits:
1. Made using Glitch, (foremerly Fog Creek)
2. Database for the project - Airtable
3. I made the logo myself lol

Version Plannings:

V3: Future Update: Will bring ability to post stories. (Will work on the advertising as well.)

V4: Lazar Update: Will bring ability to send friend requests (along with removing, blocking, and reported as well.) The entire site will also get a modern, refeshed UI.

V5: SKAR Update: Will bring ability to chat and call users (friends) and group chats.

NOTE: All bugs will be fixed in the same update they were recongnized.
